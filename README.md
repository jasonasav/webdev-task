Memory Card Game 

The game is played by clicking two tiles at a time, if a match is found then the tiles remain face up. If not, the tiles will flip back over, and the user can continue clicking on two tiles at a time until all matching cards are found. User win's once they have matched all tiles. 


User Story

Game should load a 4x4 grid. 

4x4 Grid should have similar background image. 

4x4 Grid should have two *matching* images 'hidden' behind background image, for a total of 8 matches.  

Game should have a counter with how many matches are left, on a succesful match the counter should decrease. 

If a user clicks on a tile it should swap images. 

If user matches two tiles they should remain face up. 

If user does not match two tiles, next click should 'unflip' each tile, and flip the new tile. 

There should be a direction bar at the bottom of the game, 'click a tile', 'pick one more', 'try again', 'You Win'. 











Front End Engineering Test
====================

For this test you'll create a mobile version of the memory card game in JavaScript / HTML / CSS.

If you're unfamiliar with the memory card game you can [see an example here](http://igorminar.github.io/Memory-Game/app/index.html).
